Nachos study was one of the one-month project proposed in M1-MOSIG. This is our
final report on this subject.

First, we will expose the main features of our implementation of the kernel.

Then, we will explain our implementation choices, step by step, and discuss our
organization of the past month.

Finally, we give, in an appendix section, the user documentation of system
calls we made followed by malloc documentation.
