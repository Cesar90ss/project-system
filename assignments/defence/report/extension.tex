There still exists some unimplemented functions in our kernel due to lack of
time.\\ 
For the network, the migration of process and thread safe sockets have
yet to be implemented. The process migration is still to be defined but the
sockets just miss the actual implementation of the necessary locks.\\
For the filystem, the optimisation of input/output and robustness were not
implemented.\\
In an other hand, thanks to the regression test, it is possible to say that, a
priori, every implemented part should be working. Though the set of test can
not be complete and as such it is still possible that there still exists bugs
that were not tested.\\
