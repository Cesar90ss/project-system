There still exists some unimplemented functions in our kernel due to lack of
time.\\
For the network, the migration of process and thread safe sockets has
not been yet implemented. The process migration is still to be defined, but the
sockets just miss the actual implementation of the necessary locks.\\

About file-system, optimization of input/output and robustness bonuses were not
implemented.\\
In another hand, thanks to the regression tests, it is possible
to say that, a priori, every implemented parts should be fully working. Though the set
of test can not be complete and as such it is possible that there is
still exists bugs that were not tested.\\
