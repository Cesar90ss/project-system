* Notes on user level malloc

  An implement of malloc/free as been provided as on UNIX. realloc and calloc
  are also available.

  Same rules and same prototypes as for UNIX version (see man malloc). Our
  version dynamically allocate and release pages for heap.

  In context of multithreads, you need to call memory_init into the main thread
  before forking thread to initialize synchronization structure. This is not
  needed (but not wrong) for no-thread applications (only the main thread).

  Three allocations strategy has been implemented :
  ** FIRST_FIT
  ** BEST_FIT
  ** WORSE_FIT

  To use this library, include at top of your program :

  #define BEST_FIT 1
  #include "mem_alloc.c"

  By default, the strategy is FIRST_FIT and the first line (define) is
  unnecessary. The mem_alloc.*c* is needed as Makefile only compile one file as
  a binary.
