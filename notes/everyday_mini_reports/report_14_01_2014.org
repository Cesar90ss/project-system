- Fixed the code to startup threads (still need some debug)

- Starting to create some TEST FOR REGRESSION : 
    - thread create : bad adress function
    - thread create : find more test
    - exit : 2 cases, simple and multithread
    - threadJoin : simple and multithread (- thread return : what happens in
      case of return before the end of the others threads)

- A bit more documentation have been made : threads & semaphore syscalls.

---- STILL TODO ----
- We still need to add a test about recursive threads.
- Semaphore test (producer & consumer) isnt finished.
- Finish sh and desc for all tests we made.
- What about parent exit : made or not? --> still need to make tests about it.
- Question : console is protected for one thread, what about 2 threads : 
    - use 2 semaphores : one to read and one to write in order to not block all
      writing threads during reading.
