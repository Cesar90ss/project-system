- Fixed the code to startup threads (still need some debug)

- Starting to create some TEST FOR REGRESSION : 
    - thread create : bad adress function
    - thread create : find more test
    - exit : 2 cases, simple and multithread
    - threadJoin : simple and multithread
    (- thread return : what happens in case of return before the end of the others threads)
