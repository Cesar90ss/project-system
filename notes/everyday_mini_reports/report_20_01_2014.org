- Provide test with more or less 12 processes, more or less 12 threads. (IN PROGRESS)

- Small shell (prompt + &-bg job handle)

- Heap handle... To be define!

- Kill process on bad memory access (+ test)

- When a process crash, other should not crash.

- Stress memory with a lot of processes creation / deletion.

- Create a bunch of tests about processes.

- Correct the test name : step3_test_exit_delete_children which is not passing the regression test. Actually the .sh is looking for a string which never appear in the .c file.( .desc missing)

- step4_multiple_ForkExec test is not working.(working now since change number of memory to be 512 but the threadJoinMax be error because can create > 12 thread)
