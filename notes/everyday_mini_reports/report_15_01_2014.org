---- TODO LIST FROM 14/01----
- (DONE) Semaphore test (producer & consumer) isnt finished.

- (DONE nothing to do) What about parent exit : made or not? --> still need to make tests about it.
    --> Nothing to implement : all threads are linked to a process, there is no hierarchy notion between threads!

- (DONE) Question : console is protected for one thread, what about 2 threads : 
    - use 2 semaphores : one to read and one to write in order to not block all
      writing threads during reading.

- We still need to add a test about "recursive threads". (?)

- (DONE) Finish sh and desc for all tests we made.
--------------------

---- TODO LIST ----
- Add some regression test about stack (with current Address space we should be
  able to add only 12 threads).

- Planning for next week (more or less) + explanation about how we decided to
  organize our work.

- User documentation until threads.

- Read part 4 assignement.
