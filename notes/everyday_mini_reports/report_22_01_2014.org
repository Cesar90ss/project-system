- We finished step 4 20/01. However, we still have a bug on thread stacks to
  correct (IN PROGRESS).

- We start reading step 5 and 6 in order to divide the work to do. We still
  don't know if we are going to do 2 groups : one on step 5 and one on step 6
  or not.

- PART 4 FINISHED, including bug correction

- We finally divided the team in 2 groups :
    - 2 for filesystem
    - 3 for network
