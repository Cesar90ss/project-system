(1) For the string translation from MIPS to unix world : we have to use fonctions
to read and write in the main memory because we will have a problem with
virtual memory. But we cant use ReadMem and WriteMem in machine.h (comments
saying we cant)

ANSWER : We need to use ReadMem & WriteMem (don't care of message), this is the
purpose of this function. Need to add all check to avoid kernel crashing. Also
handle big string (not a big block). We need to move copyStringFromMachine
outside machine.cc which will be better in addrspace class.

Move console outside machine directory.

(2) Question about the end of threads : how threads should end
normally.

ANSWER : Other kernel threads end with ThreadFinish.

(3) Do we have to make SynchConsole thread safe?

ANSWER : In step 3. With recursive mutex or extract main code of B inside C and B & A call C.

(4) When handling long string, do we have to return EOF if string is longuer
thant MAX_STRING_SIZE ?

ANSWER : Choice of implementation, choose to implement. Propose idea of other choices.

(5) After exit,  loops due to console interrupt. Need to stop nachos ?

ANSWER : If last processus, call Halt. Need to store global counter of all addr space.

(6) For threads, no potential concurrency probleme because syscall is atomic ? No interrupt while syscall ?

ANSWER : False, this is not the problem. No interruption.
